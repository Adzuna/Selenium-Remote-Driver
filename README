Perl Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote Driver

This is a very early (read alpha) work of Perl Bindings for Selenium 
2.0 bindings. This binding will not work with the 1.0 version of 
Selenium. Please use WWW::Selenium from CPAN if you're interested in
1.0 bindings. 

The wire protocol is going to change soon in Selenium remote server
implementation & this code is currently only going to work with 
alpha1 release of Selenium Remote Server. 

Some of the code & most of the test suites are pretty much boiler 
plate, so if you really want to play with bleeding edge code, download 
the code & play with it.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
