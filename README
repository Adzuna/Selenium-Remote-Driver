Perl Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote Driver

This is a very early (read alpha) work of Perl Bindings for Selenium 
2.0 bindings. This binding will not work with the 1.0 version of 
Selenium. Please use WWW::Selenium from CPAN if you're interested in
1.0 bindings. 

Bumped up the version to 0.10 and this should work with alpha4 release of
Selenium 2.0. The unit tests provide some examples on how to invoke the Driver
& use the module. As of this moment only live testing (i.e. no mocking) is
implemented as the Selenium server itself is in alpha.

If you really want to play with bleeding edge code, download the code & play
with it.
