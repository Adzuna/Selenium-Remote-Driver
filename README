Perl Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote Driver

This is a Perl Binding for Selenium 2.0 Remote Driver, which you should download
from http://code.google.com/p/selenium; look for selenium-server-standalone.jar.
This binding will not work with the 1.0 version of Selenium. Please use
WWW::Selenium from CPAN if you're interested in 1.0 bindings. 

Bumped up the version to 0.10 and this should work with beta1 release of
Selenium 2.0. The unit tests provide some examples on how to invoke the Driver
& use the module.
