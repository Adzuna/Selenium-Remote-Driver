# ABSTRACT: A convenience package for creating a PhantomJS instance
use Moo;
extends 'Selenium::Remote::Driver';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $driver = Selenium::PhantomJS->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class allows you to use PhantomJS through Ghostdriver without
needing the JRE or a selenium server running. When you refrain from
passing the C<remote_server_addr> and C<port> arguments, we will
search for the phantomjs executable binary in your $PATH. We'll try
to start the binary connect to it, shutting it down at the end of the
test.

If the binary is not found, we'll fall back to the default
L<Selenium::Remote::Driver> behavior of assuming defaults of
127.0.0.1:4444 after waiting a few seconds.

If you specify a remote server address, or a port, we'll assume you
know what you're doing and take no additional behavior.

If you're curious whether your Selenium::PhantomJS instance is using a
separate PhantomJS binary, or through the selenium server, you can check
the C<binary_mode> attr after instantiation.
