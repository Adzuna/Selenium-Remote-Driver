# ABSTRACT: Use GhostDriver without a Selenium server
use Moo;
use Selenium::CanStartBinary::FindBinary qw/coerce_simple_binary/;
extends 'Selenium::Remote::Driver';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $driver = Selenium::PhantomJS->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class allows you to use PhantomJS via Ghostdriver without needing
the JRE or a selenium server running. When you refrain from passing
the C<remote_server_addr> and C<port> arguments, we will search for
the phantomjs executable binary in your $PATH. We'll try to start the
binary connect to it, shutting it down at the end of the test.

If the binary is not found, we'll fall back to the default
L<Selenium::Remote::Driver> behavior of assuming defaults of
127.0.0.1:4444 after waiting a few seconds.

If you specify a remote server address, or a port, we'll assume you
know what you're doing and take no additional behavior.

If you're curious whether your Selenium::PhantomJS instance is using a
separate PhantomJS binary, or through the selenium server, you can check
the C<binary_mode> attr after instantiation.

N.B. If you're on Windows, we're probably going to fail at closing the
command window that runs the PhantomJS binary. Feel free to bug us
over at L<Github|https://github.com/gempesaw/Selenium-Remote-Driver>
and/or tell us how to fix it if it's a blocking issue for you. Thanks!

=attr binary

Optional: specify the path to your binary. If you don't specify
anything, we'll try to find it on our own via L<File::Which/which>.

);

=attr binary_port

Optional: specify the port that we should bind to. If you don't
specify anything, we'll default to the driver's default port. Since
there's no a priori guarantee that this will be an open port, this is
_not_ necessarily the port that we end up using - if the port here is
already bound, we'll search above it until we find an open one.

See L<Selenium::CanStartBinary/port> for more details, and
L<Selenium::Remote::Driver/port> after instantiation to see what the
actual port turned out to be.
