=head1 NAME

CanStartBinary - Role that a Selenium::Remote::Driver can consume to start a binary

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package ChromeDriver {
        use Moo;
        with 'Selenium::CanStartBinary';
        extends 'Selenium::Remote::Driver';
        has 'binary' => ( is => 'ro', default => 'chromedriver' );
        has 'binary_port' => ( is => 'ro', default => 9515 );
        1
    };

    my $chrome_via_binary = ChromeDriver->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role takes care of the details for starting up a Webdriver
instance. It does not do any downloading or installation of any sort -
you're still responsible for obtaining and installing the necessary
binaries into your C<$PATH> for this role to find.

The role determines whether or not it should try to do its own magic
based on whether or not the consuming class is instantiated with a
C<remote_server_addr> and/or C<port>. If they're missing, we assume
the user wants to use the Webdrivers directly and act
accordingly. We'll go find the proper associated binary (or you can
specify it with L</binary_path>), figure out what arguments it wants,
set up any necessary environments, and start up the binary.

There's a number of TODOs left over - namely Windows support is
severely lacking, and we're pretty naive when we attempt to locate the
executables on our own. You may be well served in specifying the paths
to the webdriver in question yourself, if we can't figure it out.

=attr binary

Optional: specify the path to the executable in question. If you don't
specify anything, we use L<File::Which/which> and take our best guess
as to where the proper executable might be. If the expected executable
is in your C<$PATH>, you shouldn't have to use this attribute.

As always, make sure _not_ to specify the C<remote_server_addr> and
C<port> when instantiating your class, or we'll have no choice but to
assume you're running a Remote Webdriver instance.
